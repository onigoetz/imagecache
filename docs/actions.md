### `scale_and_crop`

Scales an image to the exact width and height given.

This function achieves the target aspect ratio by cropping the original image

useful to create uniform sized avatars from larger images.

The resulting image always has the exact target dimensions.

__Options__

- `height` : The target height, in pixels or percents.
- `xoffset` : The top left coordinate, in pixels or keyword (top, left, bottom, right, center) of the crop area (x axis value),
- `yoffset` : The top left coordinate, in pixels or keyword (top, left, bottom, right, center) of the crop area (y axis value).
