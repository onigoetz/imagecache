    | Presets
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The most important part of the module, the presets.
    |
    | They're made of a a key with an array of "actions" to apply
    |
    | You can put any key you want as long as it works in a URL.
    |
    | However a recommendation is to put the size of the final image in the preset name,
    | this allows for much more reusability in your presets. because if you create a rule named "thumbnails"
    | and that your layout changes the sizes of your thumbnails but only in some places, you'll soon end in a mess with the preset names
    |
    | Preset structure :
    | 'name' => array(
    |     action,
    |     action ...
    | )
    |
    | Action structure :
    | array('action' => 'action_name', ... options ...)
    |
    | Available actions :
    | see the README for a detailed list
