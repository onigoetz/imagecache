    | Presets
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The most important part of the module, the presets.
	|
	| They're made of a a key with an array of "actions" to apply
	|
	| You can put any key you want as long as it works in a URL.
	|
	| However a recommendation is to put the size of the final image in the preset name,
	| this allows for much more reusability in your presets. because if you create a rule named "thumbnails"
	| and that your layout changes the sizes of your thumbnails but only in some places, you'll soon end in a mess with the preset names
	|
    | Preset structure :
	| 'name' => array(
	|     action,
	|     action ...
	| )
	|
	| Action structure :
	| array('action' => 'action_name', ... options ...)
	|
	| Available actions :
	| see the README for a detailed list
